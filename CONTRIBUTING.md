# Contributing to SUNRISE

## :warning: In Any Case

**Before opening an issue, opening a pull-request or contacting us:**
- Make sure that you are using the latest version of the repository
- Do a clean checkout of the repository
- Make sure what you are experiencing is reproducible (e.g. on another host system)
- Check if an issue with your topic already exists


## :question: Asking Questions

- Before asking a question, make sure you have read the documentation.
- If the question is not about our work itself (e.g. related to your environment setup): Search the internet.
- If your question is related to an existing issue, ask it there.

Otherwise: **:writing_hand: Create a new issue with the Label *question*.**


## :negative_squared_cross_mark: Reporting Bugs

*We constantly strive to improve our work, so we prioritize fixing bugs!*

In the best case, you can correct the error yourself and [contribute a fix](#-code-contributions) to the code base.

Otherwise: **:writing_hand: Create a new issue with the Label *bug*** and adhere to the following
- Explain the *expected behavior* and how the current implementation deviates from that
- Provide enough context and describe how to *reproduce the behavior*. If it cannot be reproduced, it cannot be fixed.
- For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and provide a minimal setup


## :incoming_envelope: Code Contributions

*Extensions, improvements and fixes are welcome contributions to the repository!*
xl
To contribute to the code:
- Always make sure your work is based on the latest version of the repository. Otherwise it can require high merge effort and will probably be rejected.
- Create a fork of this repository, apply the changes there and create a pull-request to our code-base from your work
  - Add sufficient information to the pull request so the intention is clear
  - Link to an existing issue if available


A **pull-request** will be merged into the code-base, if:
- The contribution is in line with the project objectives
- The code meets our expectations for code quality
- The contribution does not break any functionality
- That you **adhere the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/dco) by signing the commit**.
  (e.g. with `git commit -s -m 'Your commit message'`).
