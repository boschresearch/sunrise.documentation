# The SUNRISE Framework

![SUNRISE Logo](img/sunrise_logo.svg){: style="height:240px"}

The **SUNRISE** framework (**S**calable **Un**ified **R**ESTful **I**nfrastructure for **S**ystem **E**valuation) defines an infrastructure that provides a user-friendly, unified approach to access various simulation technologies and boost efficiency of system evaluation by leveraging decentralized compute resources for deployment of execution workloads. The solution is based on a strong modularization and connection of the components via APIs.

*For formal information see [**About**](about.md).*
